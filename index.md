# Xavier Stone - The Story

## Younger Days
   When I was a kid I used to make games; I mean all the time. Sure at first I would bend the rules to win, but as time went on I began designing for a higher power: the raw beauty of the game itself. A well-designed game is basically just an elegant mathematical algorithm with a fancy interface, so it's no surprise that when I discovered the BASIC compiler on my middle school's laboratory computer it was a match made in heaven. Through most of high school, programming was still about the game, but at some point along the way it began to be more and more about the sheer elegance of writing some gorgeous code. This deeper beauty is what drew me to a computer science degree. Once you get past all the red tape of inconsistent interoperability and competing conventions, all you're left with is essentially mathematics, and I'm good at math. Through the Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science Degree Program, culminating in the Capstone project, I have distilled not only a well-rounded array of desirable computer skills and habits, but the essence of why Computer Science appeals to me as well.

## Learned Organization
In my early personal experiments with programming, I was a maverick, and not really in a good way. My early programs were function-less lists of procedural code: a house of cards that a single typo could render non-functional. I got a little bit better as time went on, but it wasn't really until this degree program that I started to really internalize the value of structure and organization. I'm a good student, but being a good student is basically just being good at following directions, so that's not really a bragging point. This program didn't teach me how to be a good student though, it taught me how to think for myself and follow my own compass. Many times throughout the course of this program I encountered outdated technology, graded assignments with crucial typos in them, and simply incorrect instructions. I am thankful for these defects because they forced me to think outside the box and to solve unexpected problems on the fly. An example of this, which is an example of collaborative skills as well, was the class on team work and version control. The code we were provided for the class looked like something I would've written in high school. Each classmate was represented as an entirely new class named after them, which all had exactly the same attributes! A better solution would be to create a class Student with a “name” attribute and just create instances of it for each student. This was only the first of many enhancements I pitched to the class via the BitBucket communication interface. I was not surprised to receive little interest, but luckily a few other students jumped on board and we were able to really improve the code. Now if they would only incorporate those changes into the next semester... but is that really the point?

## Communication Skills
I definitely learned to communicate to a variety of audiences in this program, from children to students to peers to stakeholders. In my class on Hardware Components we were asked to design a shopping list of components for a small photo start up, and I meticulously identified the best fit for each internal desktop component, which was far beyond the requirements for the project. In addition, I took care to explain the reasoning behind each choice in terms the non-technical CEO would understand. This general approach was utilized in most of my other classes too. As previously mentioned though, the core appeal of computer science for me is in the data structures and algorithms. This appeal grew even stronger throughout this program. For example, I have created a breadth of modular functions for my OpenGL class to reduce the repetition inherent in graphics programming.

## Capstone
Certainly, though, the strongest testament to my skills is the capstone project, Backyard. This is a campsite locator app I built from scratch, initially for a Computer Platform Technologies class. That class, unlike so many of my classes, just threw me overboard essentially from day one and challenged me to figure out how to swim. The result was well-received, but underwhelming by my own standards: far too reminiscent of my old coding practices. However, this also made it the perfect candidate for an ePortfolio: not only do I get to showcase the whole gamut of skills by building an app, I get to massively improve a previous piece of work. Due to the wide range of technologies and abilities required to put this project together, it serves as a singular demonstration of my capabilities. In addition to the above mentioned skills, which are all represented in this project as well – version control leaving room for eventual collaboration, communication with stakeholders, and data structures/algorithms – software engineering/database skills as well as security feature in this project. The locally stored SQLite database used in the original app has been upgraded to a remote MongoDB instance which the app can communicate with via a special server that I built off of a simple Spring tutorial (Spring, 2020). Essentially, though, I configured a fully-functioning stack myself. Security was limited to password hashing for the scope of this project, but will be extended down the line. In conclusion, this program has been very valuable to me and helped to shape me into a well-rounded candidate for a software development position.

## The Basic Gist
Backyard is a free and open-source social interface and logistical utility for finding and sharing local spots such as campsites, watering holes, or simply all-around cool places. The user interface is unique, woodsy, and has a bit of an attitude so as to provide the user with an experience more like interacting with a peer than with a machine. Although currently the features are limited, the developmental focus is on creating a strong foundation that will simplify the process of adding features later.

## How I Kicked Butt
This project showcases the well-rounded set of skills required to develop an app from scratch, as well as an ability to take multiple viewpoints while managing a cohesive software development life cycle. Software design is evident in the ability to make full use of the available Android Studio layouts to deliver a symmetrical and clean interface. Organization is shown through the use of clear comments, simple structures and algorithms, and version control. Testing is clear in the Git history through the recorded resolution of emergent bugs. Continuous process improvement is showcased through the increasing organization and elegance of the documentation and design throughout the course of the project. My cultural values come through as well, as the app will be free and open-source, developed on Github, with privacy in mind and the option to browse anonymously. Even the concept of the app itself empowers individual users to contribute and share good sites with each other. My personality also comes through in the app's eccentricity and a lack of willingness to blindly subscribe to existing conventions.
    
## The Crown Jewel
The biggest enhancement for the Backyard campsite locator app is a database makeover. The initial app used a hard-coded local SQLite database that was neither persistent nor remotely accessible. The makeover transformed the app's back end structure into a remote MongoDB server. For testing purposes I ran the MongoDB instance, as well as a small Java RESTful server interface, from my laptop, which the Android emulator was able to connect to by means of an IP mask (10.0.2.2, representing the host computer's localhost). The flexibility of non-structured query language plus the convenience of a remote database is a huge improvement over the previous back end, but there are further enhancements needed in this category to make the app ready for deployment. The server would need to be hosted at a web address, or on the cloud, either of which would require some overhead. However, this app is currently just an example of my skills, so these real-world considerations are superfluous for the time being.

## More Bragging
The construction of a full stack more or less from scratch highlights the well-rounded coverage of my skills. I did appropriate the Spring server from a guide, and it is more or less prepackaged, but this usage is well within the licensing and given the limited time I had to pull a full stack together, quite reasonable. In addition, adding the Mongo interface was all me. Database skills are a hot commodity in computer science, and this enhancement certainly shows my capabilities in that category. In another vein, not relying on pre-made cloud services shows my moral beliefs and stubborn integrity to follow my principles even when the path of least resistance is readily available. While this might not help me land a job at Google, it will help me land a job I can be proud to do every day.
    
## Security
Due to the database currently having no permanent home, it doesn't make sense to properly secure it. However, once the database has a permanent home, there will be an admin user, support users, and a client user to represent the app, each with the appropriate level of permissions. In addition, communication packets would be encrypted. Although I am not securing the database in this trial version, I did implement user password hashing. The algorithm I chose was PBKDF2, because according to Baeldung author Sam Millington (2020), it is the most secure hashing algorithm that ships with Java. This was sufficient for my purposes, as Millington says the algorithm provides good security. In addition, the less dependencies added to the app, the more lightweight it will be.
    
## Important Lessons
The most important lesson for me through the course of this project is the value of organization throughout the development process. I have increasingly begun to use Git for its full organizational potential, and while I have made an irrational effort to avoid merge conflicts, I have increasingly used branches and small commits to organize my work. In addition, my backlog document, although not part of the repository, has become increasingly organized and reflective of the Git structure. I am making use of an online GitHub repository as well, xavierstone/backyard, and it is good knowing that I have a fallback option if my local storage ever fails. The main challenge I have had to face is Hofstader's Law: the tasks needed to complete this project always take more time than expected, even when I take into account that fact. It's been a struggle and I have had to let several features fall down the totem pole, but in prioritizing the core necessities of this program, I have paved the way to make adding features far easier down the line. All in all, this has been a powerful experience for me. I have grown my app from pure chicken scratch to a powerful foundation with real potential.
